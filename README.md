# 🏃 Endless Runner Game

A 3D endless runner game built in Unity where the player constantly moves forward along the **X-axis** while the **camera follows along the Z-axis**. The player must **dodge obstacles** by **jumping over them**, similar to the popular **Chrome Dino Game**.


## 🎮 Gameplay

- The **main camera** follows from the **Z-axis**, giving a unique viewing angle.
- Random obstacles appear in the player’s path.
- The player must **jump over obstacles** to survive as long as possible.
- The game ends if the player hits an obstacle.
